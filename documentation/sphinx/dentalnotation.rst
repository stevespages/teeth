Note that the names of the teeth given above are the same in each quadrant of the mouth. The terms upper or maxillary and lower or mandibulary can be used to indicate whether a tooth is from the upper or lower jaws.

Right and Left, from the perspective of the patient,  are used to indicate the side of the jaw a tooth is from.

FDI World Dental Federation (ISO3950)
-------------------------------------

Used worldwide and easily adapted to computerized charting.

Two digits for each tooth. First digit is tooth's quadrant. Second digit is the number of the tooth from the midline of the face.

Right (R) and left (L), below, are from the patient's perspective. The midline (M) is also shown. Upper is abbreviated to U and Lower to L.

Universal Numbering System
--------------------------

Used widely in the USA, it is also called the American system. Letters are used for primary dentition. In this case there is a different letter for each of the 20 primary teeth so there is no need for a prefix to indicate the quadrant. The Permanent teeth are numbered from 1 to 32 so again there is no need to indicate the quadrant.

Palmer
------

This is similar to the FDI system but an unusual symbol is used to denote the quadrant and for the primary dentition letters rather than integers are used for the teeth.

Surface Terminology
-------------------

Facial
......

The surface facing towards the face so resting either against the inner lips or cheek. For incisors and canines they can be referred to as *labial* and in posterior teeth *buccal*.

Lingual
.......

Opposite surface to facial ie facing the tongue. In maxillary teeth can be referred to as *palatal* due to proximity to the palate.

Masticatory
...........

In anterior teeth this can be *incisal* and in posterior, *occlusal*.

Mesial
......

The surface that lies closest to the (front) midline.

Distal
......

The surface that lies furthest from the (front) midline
