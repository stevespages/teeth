Overview
========

Both Primary and Permanent dentition, in each quadrant of the mouth, have two incisors (at the front of the mouth) followed by one canine.

In primary dentition the canine tooth is followed by 2 molars.

In Permanent dentition the canine tooth is followed by 2 premolars which are then followed by 3 molars.

So, in Permanent dentition there can be 32 teeth in total whereas in primary there can be 20

Succedaneous teeth are permanent teeth which have not yet emerged. These will replace one of the primary teeth. All of the primary teeth are replaced by corresponding successional teeth. In addition to this, 3 molars, which had no cournterpart in the primary teeth appear.
