================

On the index page there should be a link to create my teeth layout which should have the following options

1. Click if you only have milk teeth.

2. Click if you have milk and adult teeth with more milk than adult.

3. Click if you have milk and adult teeth with more adult than milk.

3. Click if you only have adult teeth.

On Clicking a full complement of milk or adult teeth will be displayed with each tooth denoted. The teeth should be very greyed out initially to indicate no info has been entered about the tooth.

If a tooth has not developed yet it should be outlined more clearly.

If a tooth has photos or notes associated with it that should be clear and pointer should transform on hovering over it.

If a tooth is causing concern eg pain it should be outlined in red.

Clicking a tooth gives a menu:

1. Tooth has not developed yet

2. Tooth has come out: Submenu as to why if selected

3. Upload a photo of the tooth

4. Upload a note about the tooth
